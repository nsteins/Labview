	FASTPULSER.TXT

	When first entering LabVIEW, with the camera and pulser turned on, run the following VI's
	1.) Go to the Open-Close Hardware folder
	2.) Open and run ExOpenGlobalCam.vi.  Make sure the camera open turns green (this opens the toolkit and the camera).
	3.) Open and run ExOpenGlobalPulser.vi.  Make sure the Pulser light turns green (this opens the pulser associated with the camera). Note: ExOpenGlobaCam must be run before running this VI.
	As long as you don't turn off the camera or close the camera you don't need to do these again during the LabVIEW session.	


	To run Internal pulser in focus mode (good for initial tests to make sure the system is running correctly).
	1.) Go to the Pulser Systems folder
	2.) Run ExSetupIntSuperSyncro.vi (this sets the pulser up for internal triggering)
	3.) Run ExDataCollectPulserFocus.vi


	To run Internal pulser in nframe/fast data collection mode (no display, store in RAM during collection, then store to file after collection).
	1.) Go to the Pulser Systems folder
	2.) Run ExSetupIntSuperSyncro.vi
	3.) Run ExDataCollectPulserNFrame.vi
	Note: this is fast data collection, the data is stored in RAM beneath the LabVIEW layer and only a 4 byte handle is passed around in LabVIEW.


	To run External	pulser in focus mode
	1.) Go to the Pulser Systems folder
	2.) Run ExSetupExtSuperSyncro.vi (this sets the pulser up for external triggering).
	3.) Run ExDataCollectPulserFocus.vi
	Note: this is fast data collection, the data is stored in RAM below the LabVIEW layer and only a 4 byte handle is passed around in LabVIEW.


	To run External pulser in nframe/fast data collection mode (no display, store in RAM during collection, then store to file after collection).
	1.) Go to the Pulser Systems folder
	2.) Run ExSetupIntSuperSyncro.vi
	3.) Run ExDataCollectPulserNFrame.vi


	Before leaving LabVIEW you should close the pulser and camera to clean up.
	1.) Go to the Open-Close Hardware folder
	2.) Select ExCloseGlobalPulser.vi and run it
	3.) select ExCloseGlobalCam.vi and run it
	4.) Now you can exit LabVIEW cleanly
