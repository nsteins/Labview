   Pre-Release for CoolSnap HQ DIF Camera
  
   This Dif feature for this camera has just been added to the LabView toolkit. 
   It will be in the next official release (June) of the SITK(tm) toolkit for LabView.

   Since this is an Alpha copy, please back up your previous toolkit DLLs, r3x files and examples before unzipping.
   Also back up your current SITK(tm) Libraries in your labview 6.1 user.lib dir and the two help files in your 
   labview help directory.   

   There are 
	Help folder: these files should be copied into your labview 6.1 help directory
	user libs folder: these should be copied into your labview 6.1 user.lib directory
	labview 6.1 folder: these files should be copied into your LabView 6.1 direcotory.
	ff folder: this is the examples and should be put into a separate folder (do not put these with the
		other SITK(tm) examples.
	new examples: There is also some new examples, again these should not be placed in the same directory
		as the old examples since some vis have changed and will prevent the old examples from running.
		The official release will have all the examples improved and cleaned up.

	

   There are two examples to run:
	1.) ExFFAccumCirBufBin2x.vi tests the Accum Mode of the CoolSnap HQ DIF camera.
	2.) ExPairedMode.vi tests the paired mode feature of the CoolSnap HQ DIF camera.

   There are two new Vis in the camera library are CameraGetFFvars.vi and CmaeraSetFFvars.vi
   These new VIs allow the user to set accum mode and the number of accums to be done on diff CCD.
   They also allow paired mode to be set. 1 sets, 0 unsets.
